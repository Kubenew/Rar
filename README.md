# Rar
Rar unrar
Run the rar.py file and go to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to see the UI. Fill in the form fields and click the Archive button to archive the specified file. The result will be displayed on a separate page.
Note that the above code now includes two routes - /archive for archiving a file and /extract for extracting a file. You can add the extract functionality to your UI by creating another form with appropriate fields and submitting the form to the /extract route.
First, install Flask using pip:
pip install flask
